title: Jamie Cheng, getting good at game design

Cheng: “How do we get good at design?”

Interviewer: “It’s simple to say, but what does that mean exactly?”

Cheng: “It’s a good question. I don’t really know. This is a thing you have to care about. That meant people coming in every week and playing your game, even though it sucks. That meant trying to break down design and think about the whole experience, instead of little bits. That meant reading the shitty reviews, and instead of being defensive about it, trying to understand what it really means underneath.”

Interviewer: “That to me is the key to separating out who’s going to be a good designer. Being able to read that stuff and do something with it, instead of being hurt. And it’s super hard.”

Cheng: “Even now, it’s like, I’m going to read your feedback, and then I’ll get mad and go and cool down for while, and then I’ll come back and ask you some more questions.”
