Cheng: “That’s what the game was back then. You need to play the game for five hours and then you understand it. But that’s way too much.”

Interviewer: “How did you change that? Did you take stuff away? Did you make it simpler?”

Cheng: “It’s a lot of feedback. Why did I lose here? What could I do?”

Interviewer: “How did you communicate the alternatives?”

Cheng: “A thousand little things. Like, if I go up diagonally beside a person, I can’t take them out, but I can right behind them. So I pop up the take out button and when you hover over it says you can’t do it diagonally.”
