title: Jamie Cheng, building intrinsic motivation in games
---
Cheng: “[Don’t Starve] is about intrinsic rewards. We’re not going to do extrinsic rewards. We need to really double down on that. And what does that mean? So it was all systemic. We would never tell them what their goal is.”

Interviewer: “Kevin talked about how, at one point, there was a tutorial with five things to do. And the players would do the five things and they would just stop. That’s the thing with games - you have to commit to some extreme paths. If you don’t do [extrinsic motivation], that’s fine but you shouldn’t do it at all.”
