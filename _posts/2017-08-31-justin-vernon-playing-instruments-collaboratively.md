title: Justin Vernon, playing instruments collaboratively
---

['The Messina' is an instrument that lets Vernon manipulate a sound as it's created.  In this example, Vernon can change the chords and arrangement of Michael Lewis's saxaphone in real time.]

And then me and Lewis, the instrument we were playing was only possible to play as two people, and it was just us making music as freely as humanly possible.

From an interview in [The Current ](http://blog.thecurrent.org/2016/09/justin-vernon-shares-the-stories-behind-bon-ivers-new-album-22-a-million/).
